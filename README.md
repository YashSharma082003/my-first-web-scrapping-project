# my-first-web-scrapping-project

This is my first web scrapping project. In this project I used those packages: 
* Requests — for downloading the HTML code from the IMDB URL 
* BeautifulSoup4 — for extracting data from the HTML string 
* Pandas — to gather my data into a dataframe for further processing
